## A template for a C project with tests and documentation

This is an example C project that includes tests using [utest.h](https://github.com/sheredom/utest.h) and documentation using Doxygen+Sphinx+breathe. The project is built using CMake.

### Prerequisites

Install the dependencies using conda:

```bash
conda env create
```
This will create a conda environment called `cdev` which you can activate with:

```bash
conda activate cdev
```
If you do not have conda installed, I recommend you get it from https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge .
**You will have to activate the environment every time you open a new terminal.**

### Building the project

To build the project, create a build directory and run CMake from there:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
#### You can now run the tests:

```bash
cd build
ctest
```
Every test included in the source codes under `tests` will be run.

#### Rendering the documentation

The documentation will also be generated in the `build/docs/sphinx/index.html` directory. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view it. In OSX, you can use the `open` command:
```bash
open build/docs/sphinx/index.html
```
In Windows, you can use the `start` command:
```bash
start build\docs\sphinx\index.html
```
and in Linux, you can use `xdg-open`:
```bash
xdg-open build/docs/sphinx/index.html
```


### Cleaning the project

To clean the project, just remove the `build` directory:

```bash
rm -rf build
```

### About

You can use this repo as a template for other projects. Look for the places where the current files appear (like tests/CMakeLists.txt mentioning test_my_library.cpp) to learn how to add your own files.

UTest codes are in the `tests` directory, and code is in the `src` directory. Both the codes under `src` and `tests` will look for headers in the `include` directory.

The documentation is generated from the `docs` directory. CMake will first run Doxygen to generate an XML database with the comments in the code, then Sphinx to will use that and the ReSTructuredText files under `docs/source` to generate the documentation webpage.

Some variables in `docs/CMakeLists.txt` are used to customize the webpage, like the project name, version, and author. You can change them to fit your project. By default, `docs/source/index.rst` will list the documentation for every definition in the file `include/some_library.h`
